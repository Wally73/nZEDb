/**
 * This controller is used for serving static pages by name, which are located in the `/views/pages`
 * folder.
 *
 * A Lithium application's default routing provides for automatically routing and rendering
 * static pages using this controller. The default route (`/`) will render the `home` template, as
 * specified in the `view()` action.
 *
 * Additionally, any other static templates in `/views/pages` can be called by name in the URL. For
 * example, browsing to `/pages/about` will render `/views/pages/about.html.php`, if it exists.
 *
 * Templates can be nested within directories as well, which will automatically be accounted for.
 * For example, browsing to `/pages/about/company` will render
 * `/views/pages/about/company.html.php`.
